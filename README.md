I save this Project as a Mounriver Studio Project Template, for easily add into others project.

How to import to your Mounriver :

First, download this Template (Zip file) and open the Mounriver Studio. 
- In Mounriver Studio (I use Version: v1.92)
- goto Project -> Template Management then select the Import botton.
- And then select Browse to select this template ZIP file.
This will add this project into your Mounriver CH32V003 [RISC-V] Project template.
You can create new project of CH32V003 [RISC-V] ... with this template.

 Project: 1 Channel Potentiometer-Controlled PWM
 
 MCU: CH32V003J4M6
 
 Description: This program generates a 1kHz Hardware PWM signal on PC4 (TIM1 Channel 4),
 with Duty Cycle controlled by a 10k potentiometer connected to PA1 (ADC Channel 1).
 System Clock is set to 48MHz using HSI/2 * 12.
 ADC uses 241-cycle sampling for high accuracy.

I used Grok Ai to created this project.
